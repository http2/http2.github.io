## What is HTTP/2?

HTTP/2 is a replacement for how HTTP is expressed "on the wire." It is
**not** a ground-up rewrite of the protocol; HTTP methods, status codes and
semantics are the same, and it should be possible to use the same APIs as
HTTP/1.x (possibly with some small additions) to represent the protocol.

The focus of the protocol is on performance; specifically, end-user perceived
latency, network and server resource usage. One major goal is to allow the use
of a single connection from browsers to a Web site.

The basis of the work was
[SPDY](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbelshe-httpbis-spdy-00), but HTTP/2
has evolved to take the community's input into account, incorporating several
improvements in the process.

See [our charter](http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/) for more
details of the scope of the work, as well as our [Frequently Asked
Questions](/faq/).

## Specifications

HTTP/2 is comprised of two specifications:

* Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 - [RFC9113](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9113.html)
* HPACK - Header Compression for HTTP/2 - [RFC7541](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7541.html)
 
 
## Implementations

We track [known
implementations](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations) of
HTTP/2 on our wiki.
